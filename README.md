**TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES USED**
LANGUAGE : PYTHON
ENVIRONMENT : JUPYTER NOTEBOOK
LIBRARIES : 1. PANDAS FOR DATA MANIPULATION 2. NUMPY FOR NUMERICAL OPERATIONS 3. MATPLOTLIB AND SEABORN FOR VISUALIZATION
**KEY INSIGHTS**
In this project, I explored the US Electric Vehicle (EV) Registration dataset using Pandas for data processing and Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization. Through data cleaning, feature engineering, and visual analysis, I gained meaningful insights about EV adoption trends across the United States.
1. GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION
State wise visualizations showed that EV adoption is high in the state of Connecticus ,58283 EVs registered in the given time period.
Connecticus is followed by New Jersey, 488 EVs are registered, which is very low when compared to Connecticus.
City wise visualizations showed thar EV adoption is high in Stamford city, 3046 EVs are registered in the given time period.
Stamford is followed by Westport (2140 EVs registered) ,Greenwich (2046), Fairfield (1831), and Westhartford (1730) respectively.
2. EV REGISTRATION TREND OVER TIME
EV registration trend over time shows that EV popularity in the US market is increasing steadily. From the year 2022 the EV adoption in US is increased drastically.
Average 20000 EVs are registered yearly.
3. DOMINANT VEHICLE COMPANIES
Company wise visualization showed that Tesla is the leading vehicle company registered in US. Total 21405 Tesla EVs are registered.
2nd is Toyota with 5759 EVs registered, followed by Jeep with 5302 EVs registered, Chevrolet with 2982 EVs registered and Hyundai with 2882 EVs registered.
4. DOMINANT BATTERY TYPE
64.2% registered EVs are BEV (Battery Electric Vehicle) followed by 35.3% PHEV (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle)
5.DOMINANT VEHICLE TYPE
31539 passenger vehicles, 25597 SUVs and 1900 Trucks are registered in the time period.
6. VEHICLE COMPANY GROWTH OVER TIME
Tesla is showing growth in the count of EVs registered in the period of time.
Other companies only have a limited growth.
7. BATTERY TYPE REGISTRATION OVER TIME
The BEV registration is showing a steady growth over time.
The PHEV registration is showing a slight decline in 2024.
**FUTURE SCOPE**
This dataset does not contain Main EV features like Battery Performance and Charging Infrastructure. Based on this we can further analyze the dataset to understand the EV adoption patterns among various region, EV manufacturers, Battery Performance etc.
Analyze long-term battery performance by integrating datasets containing battery health, degradation rates, and charging cycles to understand how different batteries behave over time.
Study battery capacity trends across manufacturers to identify which brands deliver the most reliable or energy-efficient battery systems.
Investigate the relationship between temperature, climate zones, and battery degradation, since weather can significantly affect EV performance.
Examine charging station density vs. EV adoption, helping determine whether infrastructure availability drives registration growth.
Predict future charging station demand using forecasting models that link EV growth rates to infrastructure requirements.
Assess charging costs across regions, correlating energy prices with EV adoption and user charging patterns.
Analyze the impact of new technologies, such as solid-state batteries or ultra-fast chargers, on future EV registration trends.
**CONCLUSION**
The visual analysis demonstrates that EV adoption in the US is steadily increasing, led primarily by a few major manufacturers and certain battery technologies. Geographic trends highlight strong regional differences, with certain states and cities becoming early leaders in EV usage. The combination of Pandas and Seaborn proved highly effective for transforming raw registration data into meaningful insights.

This project shows how data visualization plays a crucial role in understanding real-world EV trends, supporting decision-making for transportation planning, sustainability efforts, and future EV market strategies.
